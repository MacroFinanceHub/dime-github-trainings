# Creating a GitHub account

Creating an account is easy, you can do so by following [this link](https://github.com/join), but we recommend that you read through the best practices below first.

### Best practice creating account

1. **Use a private email address** - We have had colleagues who has lost access to their GitHub account after losing access to work email when changing jobs, so use a personal email when you create your account. You can afterwards add your work email and have any notifications from GitHub sent there.

2. **No need for multiple accounts** - Most people use the same account, even when working for different organization or for personal projects like hosting a web site. So if you already have an account, there is no need to create a second one.

### Best practice settings

Here are some optional settings that we have found heling teams to be productive on GitHub

#### Profile picture
Let's not turn GitHub into another social media platform, but there is one good reason why everyone should replace the automatically the generated profile picture with a picture of your choice. Note that your profile picture does not need to be a picture of you, it just need to be unique to you.

Once a project is actively using GitHub to manage a research project it will be much faster to scan through discussions and commit histories if everyone uses a profile picture unique to them.

This will increase the productivity in the team, especially for those manager and repo maintainer that need to keep an overview of what is going on in a repo, and who is doing what.
