# Creating a GitHub account

Creating an account is easy, you can do so by following [this link](https://github.com/join), but we recommend that you read through the best practices below first.

1. **Use a private email address** - We have had colleagues who has lost access to their Github account after losing access to work email when changing jobs, so use a personal email when you create your account. You can afterwards add your work email and have any notifications from GitHub sent there.

2. **No need for multiple accounts** - Most people use the same account, even when working for different organization or for personal projects like hosting a web site. So if you already have an account, there is no need to create a second one.
