# Intro to Git and GitHub training - Contributor

This repository was created for a training session of [DIME Analytics](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/data-and-analytics) Intro to Git and GitHub Training - Contributor. You can read more about DIME Analytics Git and GitHub trainings [here](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings).

This is one of two beginner trainings. This one is for the Contributor role which is someone that will make contributions to the code using Git/GitHub, not just give feedback to code hosted in GitHub. You can read more about the Contributor role and other roles in DIME Analytics suggested GitHub project roles [here](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings/blob/master/GitHub-resources/DIME-GitHub-Roles/DIME-GitHub-roles.md).

## About this training

This training targets both absolute beginners and someone who have used Git/GitHub a little bit but are not sure they understand what is the best way to contribute to a project using Git/GitHub. This training will not teach you everything about Git and GitHub, but after this training you will be able to contribute to a repository and know what you are doing - i.e. being a Contributor (see link to description of that role above).

This training will not teach you how to create a repository, how to set up work flow and best practices for a team using Git/GitHub, or how to solve conflicts etc. in a repository. The assumed context for someone attended this training is that they are someone who just joined a team already using Git/GitHub, or that their team is about to start using Git/GitHub and your team has access to someone that can help you with all those things. While those things are not covered in this training, you will be able to figure out most of them yourself after you gain some experience after this training if you are willing to use Google a little bit.

We hope you will end up liking Git as much as we do!

## Content in this repository

While Git/GitHub is a tool primarily for contributing on code, there will be no code during this training, as our experience is that code tend to be distracting as participants can't help trying to read the code to find out what it is trying to do. So this training is 100% programming language agnostic and has no requirement of any level of coding skills.

Instead we will create an archive of great song lyrics. We will add lyrics to this repository in .txt files. We use that file format as it will behave the same way as any code file, but without distracting anyone of us.

## Doing this training on your own

If you are not a participant of this training session and want to follow this training on your won, then you go to [DIME Analytics GitHub training repo](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings) where you find all the material related to this training. Although, this training was developed to be an interactive training taught by an instructor, but we are happy to share all material anyways.

In DIME Analytics GitHub training repo you will the [LaTeX](https://github.com/worldbank/DIME-LaTeX-Templates) code to generate the slides used in this training, and you will find jupyter notebook code that you can run to create your own copy of this repository that you can interact with.
