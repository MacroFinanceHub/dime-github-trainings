# Intro to Git and GitHub - Team Maintainer

This training is an introduction to the role of [Team Maintainer](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings/blob/master/GitHub-resources/DIME-GitHub-Roles/DIME-GitHub-roles.md#team-maintainer) on GitHub. What is called _Teams_ on GitHub are used to allow the project teams to control who has access to the their repositories.
The Team Maintainer is role in _Teams_ on GitHub. There is typically only one Team Maintainer per team, but in large teams it makes sense to make more than one person Team Maintainer.

Team Maintainers are also the person that the account admins would use as a first point of contact if they have any question related to the _Team_ or any of the repository that the team is used for. The Team Maintainer does not need to know the answer, but should know who the account admins can talk to.
