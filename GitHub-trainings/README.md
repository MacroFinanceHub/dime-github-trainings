# DIME GitHub Trainings

These trainings are all developed under the MIT License meaning that anyone can use these trainings for any purpose, including commercial. You may also modify these trainings before using them, but we would appreciate if you shared your suggested improvement. Either in an issue in this repository, or by sending us an email at dimeanalytics@worldbank.org.

While you are free to use this material as you see fit, most of this material is not developed as self-teaching material and might not make sense without in-person instructions. Although, even though it *might* not be useful we still want to share it in case it is not. If you want us to organize a training for you or your team, please reach out to us at dimeanalytics@worldbank.org and we will see if we are able to accommodate that.

## Content

All trainings come with LaTeX code to generate slides, and python code to generate test repositories.

If you are following these trainings by yourself we have provided code you can use to re-create the training repositories. The Jupyter Notebook code that uses the GitHub API to create the training repositories can also be found in this repository. See each training for more details.

## The different trainings

We will continuously develop more resources based on the demand from the teams within DIME. These are the current state of our GitHub training portfolio:

### Existing trainings
* **Intro-Git-GitHub-Contributor** - This training require no previous experience and will teach the attendee to explore and contribute to a code hosted in Git/GitHub using GitHub.com and GitHub Desktop.
* **Intro-Git-GitHub-Observer** - This training require no previous experience and will teach the attendee to explore and provide feedback on code hosted in Git/GitHub using GitHub.com.

### Trainings in development

* **GitBetter** - This training can be self-taught and is aimed towards someone who comfortable using the basics of Git/GitHub and want to start having a deeper understanding how Git works and how GitHub is implemented, and how to use that understanding to be a better *Contributor* and eventually an excellent *Repo maintainer*.

### Possible future trainings

* **Git-GitHub-Repo-maintainer** - This training trains the attendee in things necessary for be someone who is responsible to set up and uphold the work flow for a project hosted in Git.
