# Intro to Git and GitHub training - Observer training

This repository was created for a training session of [DIME Analytics](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/data-and-analytics) Intro to Git and GitHub Training - Observer. You can read more about DIME Analytics Git and GitHub trainings [here](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings).

This is one of two beginner trainings. This one is for the Observer role which is someone that browse and provide feedback to code hosted in GitHub, but will not make contributions to the code. You can read more about the Observer role and other roles in DIME Analytics suggested GitHub project roles [here](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings/blob/master/GitHub-resources/DIME-GitHub-Roles/DIME-GitHub-roles.md).

We hope you will end up finding Git and GitHub as useful as we do!

## Content of this repository

This repository contains a country-fact file where the team member in DIME Analytics has written facts about their countries. Many of these facts are incorrect as a point of this training is for the person who attends this training will be trained in how to use GitHub to provide feedback on content that is wrong and needs to be updated. The country facts were written by the members of DIME Analytics at the time of creating this training, and we like to make fun of ourselves and the places we are from.

We do not use code in our trainings as not everyone attending our trainings use the same programming language, and code that is unfamiliar to you is distracting. That is why we use this country-fact file to practice on, so we can learn the GitHub features we will use on code in the future, without being distracted by code during the training.

## Doing this training on your own

If you are not a participant of this training session and want to follow this training on your won, then you go to [DIME Analytics GitHub training repo](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings) where you find all the material related to this training.
