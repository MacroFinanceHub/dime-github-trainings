# Intro to Git and GitHub training - Observer training

This repository was created for a training session of [DIME Analytics](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/data-and-analytics) *Intro to Git and GitHub Training - Observer*. You can read more about DIME Analytics Git and GitHub trainings [here](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings).

This is one of two beginner trainings. This one is for *Observers*: users that browse and provide feedback to code hosted in GitHub, but do not make code contributions. You can read more about Observers role and other roles in DIME Analytics [Suggested GitHub Project Roles](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings/blob/master/GitHub-resources/DIME-GitHub-Roles/DIME-GitHub-roles.md).

We hope you will find Git and GitHub as useful as we do!

## Content of this repository

This repository contains a country-fact file. Many of these facts are incorrect, intentionally, as this training teaches how to use GitHub to provide feedback on content that is wrong and needs to be updated. The country facts were written by the members of DIME Analytics at the time of creating this training; we like to make fun of ourselves and the places we are from.

We do not use code in our trainings as not everyone attending our trainings uses the same programming language, and code that is unfamiliar to you is distracting. Instead, we use this country-fact file, to teach the GitHub features you will use on code in the future, without getting distracted by code during the training.

## Doing this training on your own

This training was developed to be an interactive training taught by an instructor, but we are happy to share all material. If you are not participating in an in-person session and want to do this training on your own, go to [DIME Analytics GitHub training repo](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings). There, you find the [LaTeX](https://github.com/worldbank/DIME-LaTeX-Templates) code to generate the slides used in this training, and the jupyter notebook code that you can run to create your own copy of this repository that you can interact with.
